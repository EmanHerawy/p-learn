<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project


Extensive research highlights a pressing need to enhance financial literacy among young individuals. PLEARN, our blockchain-based virtual board game, addresses this gap by delivering financial education in an engaging manner. Our aim is to equip the youth with essential financial skills, reducing costs related to financial management, enhancing financial safety nets, and ensuring financial security. A growing divide exists between the financial responsibilities placed on young individuals and their ability to make informed financial decisions. PLEARN acts as a bridge to close this gap and empower the youth to make wise financial choices, understanding that the key to financial freedom lies in making your money work for you, not just earning more. Through PLEARN, players gain hands-on experience in managing finances by investing, trading, and real estate transactions.




<!-- Problems -->
## :bomb: Problems
- Basic knowledge: 1 in 5 teens lacks a basic foundation to build on for financial literacy.

- Spending: Annual wasteful consumption of youth (under 39) is approximately $11.7 billion

- Managing: 74% of teens don’t feel confident about their financial education.

- Lack of sustainable finance literacy in school

- The gap between the amount of financial responsibility given to the young and their demonstrated ability to manage financial decisions and take advantage of financial opportunities, is rapidly widening. Unless significant action is taken to alter this, financial illiteracy will remain an obstacle to Millennials’ financial security and that is what we are trying to solve through PLEARN. 

<!-- Solution -->
## :woman_technologist: Solution

The Edutainmetn solution we are providing to the market through our game, PLEARN, is a unique and engaging approach to financial education. PLEARN leverages blockchain technology to create a virtual board game that offers players a hands-on experience in managing their finances. It addresses the pressing need for improved financial literacy, especially among the youth.

Through PLEARN, players learn essential financial skills by participating in activities such as investing, trading in both stock and cryptocurrency markets, and purchasing real estate. This immersive experience is designed to make financial education fun and relatable, encouraging players to make informed financial decisions.

By combining entertainment with learning, PLEARN helps users minimize costs associated with financial products, strengthen their financial safety net for emergencies, and ultimately enhance their financial security. Our solution aims to empower individuals to take charge of their financial futures by making their money work for them, a key aspect often overlooked in traditional financial education. PLEARN is a pioneering and interactive tool for building financial literacy and helping individuals achieve financial freedom.

### :octopus: Polkadot ink bounties!
1- Polkadot Bounty

Most Innovative ink! dApp
All dApp categories are eligible. Porting EVM apps and deploying with ink! is allowed as well. Be creative!

We expect to see well written Readme explaining what the projects are about and how their implementations were made.

Decentralized Identity: Polkadot's identity management can be integrated to offer players secure and user-friendly login credentials. This will provide enhanced security and privacy, allowing players to maintain control over their in-game achievements and assets.
Decentralized Identity for Characters: Using Polkadot's decentralized identity solutions, players can have secure and user-friendly login credentials for their in-game characters. This provides additional security and a more personal connection to their avatars.
Community Governance for Character Development: Implementing Polkadot's governance features can enable players to propose and vote on character changes or additions. This creates a sense of ownership and collaboration within the gaming community, allowing players to shape the future of in-game characters.
Cross-Chain Character Adoption: PLEARN can use Polkadot's cross-chain capabilities to introduce characters from other blockchains. For instance, characters or avatars from other Polkadot-based games could become accessible in PLEARN, enhancing the diversity and appeal of in-game characters.


2-AZERO.ID

Best project using ink!athon or AZERO.ID bounty

In PLEARN, we'll use the ink!athon framework to streamline our dApp development. This integration will greatly expedite our game's feature development and enhance its modularity. For example:

Using AZERO.ID will enable us to tie an identity to each player persona, so the player will be able to change or add other blockchain addresses in the future.
Game Assets and NFTs: Using ink!athon, we can quickly create, manage, and trade in-game assets as NFTs. These assets will be securely recorded on the Polkadot network, ensuring true ownership and provable scarcity. This integration not only simplifies our asset management but also gives players more confidence in the value of their in-game holdings.
AZERO.ID Integration: We'll incorporate AZERO.ID to create a secure and user-friendly environment for player identity management. Players will have their unique domains, strengthening the connection between their in-game personas and their real-world identities.
Team Collaboration: We'll use the ink!athon framework to foster team collaboration within the development process. This will expedite our feature development and create a more engaging and dynamic game environment for players.

3- Aleph Zero

Integrating Aleph Zero and ink! into PLEARN can offer unique character ownership through NFTs, enabling character-specific benefits within the game. Furthermore, by connecting to Aleph Zero's DeFi ecosystem, we can create innovative financial applications within the game, allowing players to explore financial management, investments, and other DeFi functionalities through their in-game characters and assets. This integration can enhance user experiences and financial literacy.

4- ASTAR

Participating in the ASTAR bounty is an excellent opportunity to strengthen the character part of your game and leverage the blockchain's capabilities to provide secure and verifiable character ownership, transactions, and marketplace interactions. This aligns with PLEARN's concept of combining financial education with an immersive gaming experience.


## How to Integrate:

Ink! Smart Contracts for NFT Characters: Develop ink! smart contracts that represent the in-game characters as NFTs. This establishes a blockchain-backed ownership system.

User-Friendly Interface: Create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing characters. Ensure that players can easily view, trade, or customize their NFT characters.

Innovative Backend: Make use of ink! for efficient backend processes. Ink! is known for its scalability, which can support the large number of in-game characters and transactions.

## Beneficial Outcomes:

Enhanced Ownership: Players will have verifiable ownership of their in-game characters through blockchain NFTs.

Secure Transactions: All character transactions, including trading or customization, can be conducted securely on the blockchain.

User Engagement: The ability to own, trade, and customize characters can boost user engagement.

Marketplace Opportunities: With NFT characters, you can create a character marketplace, allowing players to buy, sell, or exchange characters, introducing new revenue streams.

Blockchain Security: By integrating with ink!, you reinforce trust and confidence among players, as character ownership is securely recorded on the blockchain.

- Asset Management: By the end of the game, players should be proficient in managing their assets, which may include optimizing investment portfolios, property management, and wealth diversification.

- Long-Term Financial Planning: PLEARN encourages players to consider their long-term financial goals, such as retirement planning, and how to create a sustainable financial future.

- Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Knowledge: For players to fully grasp the potential of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies in today's financial landscape.
  

#### Game Components
The game components of PLEARN include various elements that contribute to the gaming experience and the learning of financial literacy. These components are designed to engage players and provide opportunities to gain practical knowledge about finance, investments, and asset management. Here are the key game components:

- Game Board: A virtual game board that serves as the central gameplay area, where players navigate through financial scenarios and investment opportunities.

- Game Tokens: Virtual tokens representing players on the game board. These tokens are moved to different spaces as players progress through the game.

- Assets: These represent the financial resources available to players. Assets can include virtual currency, stocks, cryptocurrencies, and real estate properties.

- Market Spaces: Spaces on the game board that simulate real-life financial markets, such as stock exchanges and cryptocurrency markets. Players can buy and trade assets here.

- Event Cards: These cards introduce random financial events and challenges that players must navigate. Events can include market fluctuations, investment opportunities, and unexpected expenses.

- Mission Cards: Missions are financial challenges and tasks that players must complete to gain rewards and advance in the game. These missions relate to different aspects of financial literacy.

- Player Profiles: Each player has a virtual profile that tracks their progress, investments, and financial decisions throughout the game.

- Blockchain Integration: This unique component allows players to experience real ownership of in-game assets by leveraging blockchain technology. It provides transparency and security to in-game transactions.

- Educational Content: Alongside the game, educational content is provided to players. This can include explanations, tutorials, and real-world financial tips to enhance financial literacy.

- Leaderboards: A feature to track player performance and achievements. It encourages competition and motivation to improve financial knowledge.
    

#### Game Setup:
1. Wallet Connection: Users can integrate their MetaMask Wallet seamlessly into the platform. This wallet connection will be essential for managing in-game assets and transactions.

3. In-Game Currency: PLEARN primarily operates with USDT (Tether) as the in-game currency. If users do not possess USDT, they can convert their fiat currency into USDT within the platform. Alternatively, users can deposit their existing USDT to initiate their financial adventures.

4. Avatars as NFTs: User profiles, represented as avatars, are unique NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). Players have the flexibility to incorporate their pre-owned NFTs into the game. Additionally, they can mint brand-new avatars directly within the platform. This NFT integration adds a personalized touch to the gaming experience.

5. Transaction Fees: For every financial move within the game, players will encounter transaction fees. The specific percentage for these fees is under consideration, ensuring a balance between fair gaming and platform sustainability.

#### Game Phases:
Phase 1 PvE (Players vs Environment): in this phase players will be playing against the environment, so, there will be no interaction with other players. Phase 2: PvP (Player vs Player): players will interact with each other. This mode will be unlocked after the player finishes PvE mode. Once players arrive in this phase, they will be able to buy & sell between each other.
